# 0x14. C - Bit manipulation

## Task 0.0

[0-binary_to_uint.c:](https://github.com/SteveMuiyuro/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x14-bit_manipulation/0-binary_to_uint.c) is a program that converts a binary number to an unsigned int.

`Return Value:`the converted number, or 0 if:

- there is one or more chars in the string b that is not 0 or 1

* b is NULL

## Task 1.1

[1-print_binary.c:](https://github.com/SteveMuiyuro/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x14-bit_manipulation/1-print_binary.c) is a program that prints the binary representation of a number.

## Task 2.10

[2-get_bit.c:](https://github.com/SteveMuiyuro/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x14-bit_manipulation/2-get_bit.c) is a program that returns the value of a bit at a given index.

`Return Value:` the value of the bit at index index or -1 if an error occured.

## Task 3.11

[3-set_bit.c:](https://github.com/SteveMuiyuro/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x14-bit_manipulation/3-set_bit.c) is a program that sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index.

`Return Value:` 1 if it worked, or -1 if an error occurred.

## Task 4.100

[4-clear_bit.c:](https://github.com/SteveMuiyuro/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x14-bit_manipulation/4-clear_bit.c) is a program that sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index.

`Return Value:` 1 if it worked, or -1 if an error occurred.

## Task 5.101

[5-flip_bits.c:](https://github.com/SteveMuiyuro/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x14-bit_manipulation/5-flip_bits.c) is a program hat returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another.

## Task 6. Endianness

[100-get_endianness.c](https://github.com/SteveMuiyuro/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x14-bit_manipulation/100-get_endianness.c) is a rogram that that checks the endianness.

`Return Value:`0 if big endian, 1 if little endian.

## Extras

[main.h:](https://github.com/SteveMuiyuro/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x14-bit_manipulation/main.h) Contains the prototypes of all functions in the `0x14-bit_manipulation` directory.

[\_putchar.c:](https://github.com/SteveMuiyuro/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x14-bit_manipulation/_putchar.c) contains the prototype of the function `_putchar`
